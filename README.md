# R Subsetting Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error in R programming related to data subsetting.  The bug arises from incorrectly using the assignment operator `=` instead of the comparison operator `==` when creating a subset of a data frame based on a condition. The correct usage and solution are also included.

The bug is explained in detail in the `bug.R` file.  The corrected version is provided in `bugSolution.R`.
